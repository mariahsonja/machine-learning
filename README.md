### NLP Jupyter Notebooks Examples in Python :snake: 

In this repository I added a collection of jupyter notebooks with 
examples of TensorFlow NLP *models*, *word embeddings*, *encoding*, *neural network*, *text processing*, etc.


**It contains:**

- `data` 
- `encoding-embeddings` 
- `mix`  
- `neural-network`
- `tensor-intro-review`
- `text-processing`


*This collection of Jupyter Notebooks came from my own studies and trainings I have done during the past years. They are all updated to be used with `Python 3.7`.*
